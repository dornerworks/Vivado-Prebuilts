This repo contains the items necessary to boot the RocketChip on the ZCU102 FPGA fabric.

## Platforms

### rocketchip

Base rocketchip design

### Rocketchip-h-extend

Rocketchip with the Hypervisor extensions to run Virtual Machines

## Flash Rocket

Use the flash_rocket.sh script to flash the ZCU102 with the rocketchip FPGA along with a payload
inputted with the script.

```sh
source flash_rocket.sh ../../test/images/sel4-riscv-vmm-image-riscv-rocketchip
```

When the `ElfloaderImage` CMake variable is set to "binary", the monolithic image will be
identical to the `fw_payload.bin` generated by OpenSBI.

Use `source` to run the script, as that will ensure the necessary environment variables
are properly set.
